## Discription
This project is a timed coding quiz. Its designed to test your knowledge and understanding of Web Development in this case. However, its questions and answers can be restructured and presented for any topic. This is a multiple choice quiz that has a sixty second timer which begins the moment you click the start button. For each question thats answered incorrectly, time is docked from the sixty second timer. When all of the questions are answered, or when the clock reaches zero, the game ends. At the end of the game you will be able to save your score to the browsers local database.
